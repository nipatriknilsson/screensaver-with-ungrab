# screensaver-with-ungrab

Some software grab the keyboard or prevent the screensaver to lock your computer. Such software include Virtualbox, VMWare and media players. This can be a security risk.

This locker ignores any grabs and locks your computer on timeout. You need to keep the computer alive with pressing a key (i.e. CTRL) to make the locker not to lock during a media play.

The main ungrab line in locker.sh is
```
xdotool key --delay 250 Shift+Control+Alt Control+Alt Escape
```
xdotool sends sends the above keys to ungrab the grab, then you need to give the correct command to lock your computer. The script works with gnome-screensaver-command or mate-screensaver-command, which you need to change for your platform.

xautolock is set to 1 minute (install_locker.sh).

The only backdraw I have found is that you need to set the original locker to more time than xautolock. Otherwise you can sometimes have a black screen for a few seconds, when the lockers compete.

To install this locker, run install_locker.sh as the user you want to have this locker with. Next time you log in it is run.
```
chmod +x install_locker.sh
chmod +x locker.sh
./install_locker.sh
sudo cp -a locker.sh /opt/
```

To run directly without log out and in run:
```
xautolock -time 1 -secure -locker "/opt/locker.sh"
```

You need to install software missing, xdotool and xautolock.
